- 👋 Hi, I’m @ktMcD. I live in southwest Washington. 
- 👀 I’m interested in a variety of programming languages and technologies including C# full stack development, Python and distributed database languages. I enjoy writing very much and hope to contribute documentation to various repos soon.
- I am excited about writing code that assists knitters and crocheters in a variety of tasks such as repeatable patterns for socks and sweaters based on a stitcher's gauge (stitches per inch). Additionally I work as a remote team member for a well-known online mortgage provider, maintaining legacy code in Progress Openedge ABL 12.2 character.
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate on Progress Openedge ABL projects that help developers write, research and debug legacy programs. I am also interested in building my C#.Net muscles with easy first project contributions - and any documentation challenges. Sorry. I only know English.
- 📫 Please feel free to reach out me at geek.katie@gmail.com with any ideas you might have for how we can work together or how I might add some value to your project.
